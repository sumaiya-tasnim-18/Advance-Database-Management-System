# Advance-Database-Management-System
    📌 Project Name: Mall Management System

This repository contains the implementation of an Advance Database Management System (ADBMS) project titled Mall Management System. It demonstrates the complete lifecycle of database design, implementation, and application development using Oracle 10g with SQL and PL/SQL.

The Mall Management System is designed to manage the overall functionality of a shopping mall including:

# 🚀 Project Overview
	•	Shop details
	•	Customer management
	•	Employee information
	•	Sales and purchase records
	•	Billing and reporting

It provides a relational database model with user-friendly interfaces and PL/SQL procedures to handle business logic.

# 🛠️ Key Features
	•	ER Diagram – Visual representation of entities and relationships.
	•	Normalization – Data structured up to 1NF,2NF,3NF & final table creations for efficiency.
	•	Schema Diagram – Logical structure of the database.
	•	Table Creation (SQL) – SQL scripts for creating mall-related tables.
	•	Data Insertion – Sample records added to the database.
	•	Basic PL/SQL – variables, operators, single-row function, group function, loop, conditional statements, subquery.
	•	Advanced PL/SQL – stored functions, stored procedures, table-based records, explicit cursors, cursor-based records, row level triggers, statement level triggers, packages and including Exception handling.
	•	Relational Algebra – Query representation using algebraic operations.
	•	User Interface Design – Draft UI designed in Figma, then implemented in PHP based on the design.
	•	Oracle 10g Connectivity – Connected application with Oracle database.

 # ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
	•	Database: Oracle 10g
	•	Language: SQL, PL/SQL
	•	Modeling: ER diagrams, Normalization, Relational Algebra
	•	Interface: Forms/Code implementation for user interaction using PHP
